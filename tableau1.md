# Getting started with Tableau
In this exercise, you'll use the COVID-19 data from Exercise 1 (Cases and Vaccinations; Mobility) to learn some of the basics of uploading, manipulating, analysing, and plotting data in Tableau. 

## 1. Create a choropleth map of regional vaccination data 
In this example, you will upload the ```provincial-vaccinations.csv``` table that you created in [first lesson](google-sheets1) of your Google Sheets Exercise to Tableau and create a [choropleth map](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=75eff041036d40cf8e70df99641004ca). 

### Upload your data 
1. Upload your ```provincial-vaccinations.csv```

### Terminology
From [Tableau help](https://help.tableau.com/current/guides/get-started-tutorial/en-us/get-started-tutorial-drag.htm):
> ***Dimensions*** are qualitative data, such as a name or date. By default, Tableau automatically classifies data that contains qualitative or categorical information as a dimension, for example, any field with text or date values. These fields generally appear as column headers for rows of data, such as Customer Name or Order Date, and also define the level of granularity that shows in the view.
> ***Measures*** are quantitative numerical data. By default, Tableau treats any field containing this kind of data as a measure, for example, sales transactions or profit. Data that is classified as a measure can be aggregated based on a given dimension, for example, total sales (Measure) by region (Dimension).
