# Module Introduction

## Module Objectives
1.	Promote awareness of a variety of publicly available datasets and data sources; improve understanding of their uses and limitations.
2.	Using hands-on, step-by-step instruction, develop analysis and visualization skills using a variety of free applications (Google Sheets, Tableau, GitHub)
3.	Build experience and expertise producing high-quality figures and visualizations to convey clear and concise information about complex topics. 
4.	Using GitHub and GitHub Pages, explore ways in which data, code, and research findings can be shared with other researchers and members of the public alike. 

## Module Structure and Schedule 
With the exception of the introductory class on the morning of 25-May, the rest of the exercises for this module will be carried out asynchronously. 
- You'll be provided with instructions (in most cases in both text and video), and it will be up to you to complete the exercises during the day.  
<br>
On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, Jay will be available for drop-in help from 19:00 - 21:00 (7:00 - 9:00 PM) in the module [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a034faa976bc54fbca2842878fc0bf1a8%40thread.tacv2/Patterns%2520in%2520the%2520Pandemic%2520-%25202021?groupId=dc711b43-0e22-4ae9-b06f-abcf87865fc0&tenantId=44376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772). 
- The drop-in sessions are opportunities to get help where you are stuck with an exercise--they are not intended to be a step-by-step instruction session, as these are already created for you. 
- **The drop-in sessions are completely optional, but you are encouraged to attend if you are stuck.**
