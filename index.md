# Welcome to Patterns in the Pandemic. 
Whether they are being relayed to us through news outlets, government agencies, social media, or our friends and family, COVID has many narratives. But what stories do the data tell? What can we learn from trends and patterns in the multitudes of COVID data that is freely available? And perhaps more importantly, what (or who) is not included or represented properly in the data, or just generally misunderstood? 

In this module, students will have an opportunity to explore these questions by learning and apply the basics of data analysis and visualization in the service of synthesizing publicly available datasets from sources like Google, the Government of Ontario, and Statistics Canada. Using a variety of free software tools (including Google Sheets, Tableau, and GitHub), students will create a range of interactive charts, maps, and tables that illustrate Ontarioâ€™s COVID trends and patterns on a self-built website.
