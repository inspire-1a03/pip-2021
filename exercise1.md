# Exercise 1: Exploring COVID-19 patterns with Google Sheets
In this exercise, you will download some Canadian COVID data, explore it, and begin to perform some analyses using Google Sheets. You will create a number of figures that will be later inserted into your project website (as part of your work in [Exercise 2](exercise2)) as interactive charts. 

For a lot of data analysis and visualization work, spreadsheets are an excellent place to start--they provide an intuitive visual interface to explore the data, have lots of (often unknown) functions to manipulate and analyze data, and can make some quick and moderately-customizable charts.

## What you will need
- Google Sheets (i.e. a working Google account). 

## Exercise objectives 
- Download COVID-19 case, vaccination, and mobility data 
- Interpret datasets (using reference documentation)
- Manipulate and restructure datasets to allow for exploration and analyses
- Use data visualization to explore data and develop questions
- Define a number of answerable questions
- Perform analyses and generate figures to address questions

## Deliverables from this exercise
In this exercise, you will create the following deliverables:
- From Lesson 1, **3 figures** with summaries and **1 table**.
- From Lesson 2, **1 figure** with a summary. 
- Your responses to the questions provided on the [Reflection](google-sheets3) page.

**IMPORTANT:** you will insert all of these deliverables into the project website you'll create during [Exercise 2](exercise2).
