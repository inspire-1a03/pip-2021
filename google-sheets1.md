# COVID-19 Case data

## 1. Get the data 
- Download data from https://covid19tracker.ca/
- Save a copy -- this will be your working version
- A copy of this data has been prepared for you [here]()


## 2. Explore the data 
- Explore sheets/tabs
- Head to the site and read their [documentation](https://covid19tracker.ca/sources.html) to better understand where information is coming from 
- The top row contains variable names. It would be nice to have them visible always as you scroll through the data. Freeze the top row of the sheets on the screen by pulling down the horizontal grey bar at the top-left of the sheet.

There is a lot of data in this spreadsheet. Let's take a minute to list some of the variables (columns) that are available for you to explore: 
- COVID-19 cases
- COVID-19 tests
- COVID-19 hospitalizations
- COVID-19 people in critical condition
- COVID-19 recoveries
- COVID-19 vaccinations (administered, distributed)

Each of these variables are listed as a function of time -- each row is a date (defined by the column ```data >> date```).
