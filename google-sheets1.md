# COVID-19 Case data

## 1. Get the data 
In this lesson, we're using data from [COVID-19 Tracker Canada](https://covid19tracker.ca/index.html). The data presented on this website is compiled from a variety of Provincial/Territorial sources by [team of citizen volunteers](https://covid19tracker.ca/about.html). 

1. Scroll to the bottom of the main page, and follow links to download the data. 
  - Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjkemMdFSZgA-M8Esr6rbNjHiyfcXcBxPeMjselJIso/edit#gid=669830005) for a direct link to the Google Sheet. 
1. Click ```File > Make a copy``` to save a copy of this sheet to your Google Drive -- this will be your working version for the remainder of the activities.

## 2. Explore the data 
1. Take a few moments to explore the various tabs/sheets that exist in the spreadsheet. Also explore the variables (columns) that are available in the sheet. 
1. If you have any questions about the data, where it comes from, or what the variables mean, head to the project site and read their [documentation](https://covid19tracker.ca/sources.html). 
1. It would be nice to have the top row (with variable names) always visible as you scroll through the data. Freeze the top row of the sheets on the screen by pulling down the horizontal grey bar at the top-left of the sheet until it rests beneath the first row.

There is a lot of information in this spreadsheet. Let's take a minute to list some of the variables (columns) that are available for you to explore: 
- COVID-19 cases
- COVID-19 tests
- COVID-19 hospitalizations
- COVID-19 people in critical condition
- COVID-19 recoveries
- COVID-19 vaccinations (administered, distributed)

Each of these variables are listed as a function of time -- each row is a date (defined by the column ```data >> date```).
