# Exercise 3: Advanced visualization using Tableau
In this exercise, we will use [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) to perform additional data analysis and visualizations using the COVID-19 datasets that we used in Exercise 1 (Case and Vaccination; Mobility). 

## What is Tableau?
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is an analytics software company that offers a variety of products. The Tableau products that you are likely most familiar with are the full-featured desktop application [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop) and its stripped-down, free version [Tableau Public](https://www.tableau.com/products/public). All of the following exercises will be carried out using Tableau Public, though students can sign up to get Tableau Desktop [for free](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students#form).

So, *what is Tableau Public?*. From the Tableau website:
> Tableau Public is a free platform to explore, create and publicly share data visualizations online. With the largest repository of data visualizations in the world to learn from, Tableau Public makes developing data skills easy. Advance your career in analytics by learning from limitless data inspiration and creating an online portfolio of work.

In comparison to spreadsheets, Tableau offers a few advantages: 
- It has an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, which makes analysis and visualization easy.
- The software is quite good at interpreting data sets in a variety of structures, which means that it can suggest appropriate methods and visualizations. 
- It is easy to build, publish and share your visualizations with others 

## What you will need
From the [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) website:
1. Sign up for a Tableau Profile.
1. Download and install Tableau Public.
