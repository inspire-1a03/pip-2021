# Exercise 4 - Self-directed inquiry
Congratulations, you've made it to the final deliverable of our module! By this point, you've gained some skills using spreadsheets and Tableau to manipulate, scrutinize, and visualize data, as well as publish your creations to the web. This final exercise will combine all of your lessons in a self-directed manner. 

## Your task: 
- Define and attempt to respond to three research questions related to your two COVID-19 datasets. Your questions may be variations on those asked in the exercise, or you may have new ones that you want to pursue. 
- You are tasked with creating and publishing a visualization and a short analysis (100 words max) to respond to each question.  
- You will share your questions, visualization, and analyses on your project website. 

## How to do it
- You are free to use either or both of Google Sheets and Tableau to perform these analyses--whichever you prefer. 
- If you would like to use a merged dataset (of Case/Vaccination and Mobility data) for Canada and Ontario, there is one available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19aKLLj6VvjbHrPx4pvkKjGB-m-IP2q53dLhIaNX94XI/copy).

**Good luck and happy exploration!**
