# Exercise 3 reflection

In this exercise, you've explored the functionality of Tableau while making some interesting graphs with COVID-19 data. 

Responses to the following questions should be added to the corresponding page of your project website: 
- What are your initial thoughts about using Tableau vs. Google Sheets? What might be the advantages of each? 
- What inferences can you make from the Mobility data that you explored and visualized? 
- What new questions would you like to ask of the data? 
- How might you use these two datasets together to perform new analyses? 

**Finished?** It's time for your [final exercise](exercise4), where you'll apply your skills to do some self-guided data analysis!
