# Exercise 1 reflection
In this exercise, you have had the opportunity to explore a couple of different Canadian COVID-19 datasets, and you've learned how to transform, plot, and ask questions of the data. Before beginning Exercise 2, it's a good opportunity to reflect on the process and your knowledge.

- What inferences can you make from the data you have explored and visualized? 
- What questions still exist about the trends and the data? What new questions has this process generated? 
- What additional information would you like to help answer these questions? 

**Finished?** Head to [Exercise 2](exercise2) to learn how to use GitHub, Markdown, and GitHub Pages to publish your work to the web!
